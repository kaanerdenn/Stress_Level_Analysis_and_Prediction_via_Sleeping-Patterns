# Stress Level Analysis and Prediction via Sleeping Patterns

## Overview

This project is designed to analyze and predict stress levels based on various behavioral and environmental factors. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify the key influences on stress and accurately predict stress levels.

## Dataset

The dataset online_shoppers_intention.csv includes a range of features such as behavioral patterns, environmental factors, and the resultant stress levels of individuals.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and data standardization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize distributions of stress levels and feature correlations.

Feature Engineering: Implementing transformations to improve model accuracy.

Machine Learning Models: Building and evaluating models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes.

Model Evaluation: Assessing models using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Feature Importance Analysis: Using RandomForestClassifier to determine the significance of each feature.

Prediction: Applying Logistic Regression to predict stress levels in new data.

## Requirements

This project requires Python and the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
